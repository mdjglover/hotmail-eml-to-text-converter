HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!

How was your flight? We were tracking you on line :) Not for the entire time but every hour or so.

For the last two days i have done nothing but eat and read Charles Dickens... my head feels close to bursting.

How did you bring in the new year?

p.s. Japser would like to say hello to Cyril and Goergia would like to protest her undying love for her dear darling Panda that goes by the name of Cyril.
